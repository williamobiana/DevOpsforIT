# How SSL Certificate Works

HTTPS is a sercure version of HTTP\
HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) is a protocol by the browser and webserver\
(S) stands for  secure/secure socket layer (ssl)

With HTTPS, all communications between your browser and web server are encrypted.\
The ssl cerficate is a digtal web certificate that is issued by a certifacte authority(ca) that verifies the identity of the web server and its public key.

Steps of how it works
1. browser request page(HTTPS) from a webserver
2. the webserver holds its private key send its public key & ssl certificate (in a single file) verified by the certificate authority(ca) to the browser
3. browser reviews and verifies the certificate 
4. browser creates shared secerts(key) (it keeps one and sends one to the webserver with encryption. The encryption is done with the public key)
5. webserver recieves and decyptes it with its private key. Now the webserver has a compy of the browser shared secret(key).

Now all traffic between browser and webserver is automatically encrypted.
